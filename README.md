# Coding Task Solutions (Using Java)

This repository contains Java solutions for two basic programming questions.

## Question 1

**Task:**
Write a simple program that takes ten consecutive numbers (0 to 10) and computes their sum.

**Solution:**
The program uses a `for` loop to iterate from 0 to 10 and calculates the total sum.

## Question 2

**Task:**
From the same ten numbers:

* Identify the even numbers and compute their sum.
* Identify the odd numbers and compute their sum.

**Solution:**
During the same loop, the program checks each number:

* If the number is even (`num % 2 == 0`), it adds it to the even sum.
* If the number is odd (`num % 2 != 0`), it adds it to the odd sum.

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java file:

   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```

2. Run the compiled class:

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

## Output

The program prints:

* The total sum of numbers from 0 to 10
* The sum of even numbers
* The sum of odd numbers
